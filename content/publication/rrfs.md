abstract = "In this study, we reported two featured series of rRNA-derived RNA fragments (rRFs) from the small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) data of Amblyomma testudinarium using the Illunima platform. Two series of rRFs (rRF5 and rRF3) were precisely aligned to the 5' and 3' ends of the 5.8S and 28S rRNA gene. The rRF5 and rRF3 series were significantly more highly expressed than the rRFs located in the body of the rRNA genes. These series contained perfectly aligned reads, the lengths of which varied progressively with 1-bp differences. The rRF5 and rRF3 series in the same expression pattern exist ubiquitously from ticks to human. The cellular experiments showed the RNAi knockdown of one 20-nt rRF3 induced the cell apoptosis and inhibited the cell proliferation. In addition, the RNAi knockdown resulted in a significant decrease of H1299 cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. These results indicated the rRF5 and rRF3 series were not random intermediates or products during rRNA degradation, but could constitute a new class of small RNAs that deserves further investigation."
