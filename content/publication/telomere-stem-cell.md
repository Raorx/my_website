<h4>Background</h4>
Telomere length heterogeneity has been detected in various cell types, including stem cells and cancer cells. Cell heterogeneity in pluripotent stem cells, such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), is of particular interest; however, the implication and mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity remain to be understood. Single-cell analysis technology has recently been developed and effectively employed to investigate cell heterogeneity. Yet, methods that can simultaneously measure telomere length and analyze the global transcriptome in the same cell have not been available until now.
<h4>Results</h4>
We have established a robust method that can simultaneously measure telomere length coupled with RNA-sequencing analysis (scT&R-seq) in the same human ESC (hESC). Using this method, we show that telomere length varies with pluripotency state. Compared to those with long telomere, hESCs with short telomeres exhibit the lowest expressions of TERF1/TRF1, and ZFP42/REX1, PRDM14 and NANOG markers for pluripotency, suggesting that these hESCs are prone to exit from the pluripotent state. Interestingly, hESCs ubiquitously express NOP10 and DKC1, stabilizing components of telomerase complexes. Moreover, new candidate genes, such as MELK, MSH6, and UBQLN1, are highly expressed in the cluster of cells with long telomeres and higher expression of known pluripotency markers. Notably, short telomere hESCs exhibit higher oxidative phosphorylation primed for lineage differentiation, whereas long telomere hESCs show elevated glycolysis, another key feature for pluripotency.
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
Telomere length is a marker of the metabolic activity and pluripotency state of individual hESCs. Single cell analysis of telomeres and RNA-sequencing can be exploited to further understand the molecular mechanisms of telomere heterogeneity.
